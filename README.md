# DimensionalityReductionTechniques.jl

This library is intended to add various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques
that are not currently implemented in other libraries.

Most notable library that has some techniques implemented is
[MultivariateStats.jl](https://docs.juliahub.com/General/MultivariateStats/stable/) however it is
missing some techniques which I've been introduced to during a machine learning course at Faculty
of Sciences, University of Novi Sad.

The whole library is a part of a final project for said course.
