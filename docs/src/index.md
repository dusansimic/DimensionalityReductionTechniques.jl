# Introduction

This package implements various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques. Some are
already implemented in the
[MultivariateStats.jl](https://docs.juliahub.com/General/MultivariateStats/stable/) library but
during a machine learning course at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, I've been
introduced to some other techniques.

As part of a final project for the course, I've implemented techniques which at the that time were
not available in any Julia library.
